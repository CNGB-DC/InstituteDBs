DBs of BGI Research Institute, including DISSECT, PIRD, DHGV, HMD, GDRD.

## DISSECT

2. We devote ourselves to provide an integrated platform with multi-omics data and various analytic tools, in an effort to help users dissect data of common database and their own. Those analyses, from single cluster & single data type to cross clusters and multi data types, are all well-designed to be easy to use.

## PIRD

2. Pan Immune Repertoire Database (PIRD) collected raw and analyzed sequences of immunoglobulins (IG) and T cell receptors (TCR) of human and other vertebrate species with different phenotype. You can check the detailed information of each sample in the database, choose samples to analyze according your need, and upload data to analyze. Your analysis results will be auto-saved, so you can return to check them at any time.

## DHGV

## GDRD

2. GDRD database focuses on human genetic data and phenotype data. Collecting family information, genetic variant and causing mutation from publications and collaborators all over the world. Accelerate data sharing, exchange, and cooperation in the field of genetic diseases and rare diseases. You can search variant, family, and publication by just enter gene, disease, phenotype, genome region and so on.

## HMD

2. Human body is harbored by tens of trillions of microbes. These tiny creatures have been living and evolving with us for all of our history, but we still know little about them. Thanks to the explosion of sequencing techniques and big data technology, now we get the chance to have a close look of these familiar strangersâ€¦
